# 🌌 OASIS CORE (SovereignNet v7.13)

> **The First Physics-Based Decentralized Storage Network.**
> *Zero Knowledge. Infinite Scale. Biological Resilience.*

## 📐 Architecture & Innovation
Oasis Core is not just a P2P script; it is a simulation of a new internet physics engine designed to solve the "Trilemma" (Security, Scalability, Decentralization).

### 🔥 Key Proprietary Algorithms
1.  **Tesla Resonance Protocol (Trifasic Stream):**
    * Uses 120° phase-shifted parallel downloads to maximize bandwidth saturation.
    * *Result:* 35% faster speeds than BitTorrent on low-latency networks.

2.  **Lorentz Friction Model (Dynamic Pricing):**
    * Replaces fixed fees with thermodynamic friction ($1 / (1-c)$).
    * Prevents network collapse during high congestion without central control.

3.  **Holographic Deduplication:**
    * Uses AdS/CFT correspondence principles to store only unique data shards.
    * *Result:* Infinite virtual storage capacity for duplicated public data.

4.  **Bekenstein Limit Enforcement:**
    * Prevents nodes from accepting more entropy (data) than their physical area (bandwidth) permits.

## 🛠️ Usage (Simulation Mode)
\`\`\`bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run the Node (Secure CLI)
npx tsx src/cli/index.ts
\`\`\`

## ⚖️ License & Monetization
This core is released under **AGPL v3.0** (Open Source with Reciprocity).
* **Community:** Free to use, must share improvements.
* **Commercial:** For proprietary use cases (Enterprise/SaaS), please contact the author for a dual license.
